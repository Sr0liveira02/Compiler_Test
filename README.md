This is an experiment where i will be building a compiler based on a series created by CodePulse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg&list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD&index=1
where i will be building it in c++ and trying to iterate over it making it faster and more adapted to my liking and trying some other random shit

All the props to CodePulse for providing such a helpfull and educative series

To use it for yourself

make (with g++ installed)

./Shell

and then just writing some math on the terminal and it will tell you in which order is apropriated one to do the math which will be helpfull once i write everything in asmembly
