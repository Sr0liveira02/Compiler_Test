This was an experiment where i staerted building a compiler based on a series created by CodePulse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg&list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD&index=1
where i built it in c++ and stopped it momentarely.

i will be trying to iterate over it making it faster and more adapted to my liking and trying some other random stuff

All the props to CodePulse for providing such a helpfull and educative series



- To use it for yourself

make (with g++ installed)

./Shell

In this version it only does math althougth in the future if i ever comeback to this i will be adding code.


(I know i have to add tests i just forgot and was lazy to configure the make file)

For easier undestanding of my code i suggest you to read in this order:
Shell
Position
Token
Lexer
Node
Parser
Number
Interpreter
